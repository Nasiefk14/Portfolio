            <h1>Who am I ?</h1>
            <p>I am Nasief Khan the eldest of 4 kids. I am currently 21yrs old turning 22 on the 14th of May 2020. I am currently doing a Full Stack Development stream at Younglings SA, which is located in Cape Town South Africa. The way i got into software is such a weird story that i find it funny everytime i tell anybody about it, so here goes. Towards the end of my matric year I was not sure of what to study for the year to come. The following year came and it turned into a gap year, throughout the year i was playing games a little bit to much and towards the third quarter of the year I had to choose a career path. So I thought to myself at the time I love playing games so why not create games? </p> 
            <p>The following months I learnt about about Unity and C# game development and started self learning. After about 3 months I enrolled at a college in Claremont by the nameof CTU Training Solutions where i would be doing MCSD and game development was covered as well in the course. I strted at CTU in 2018 and completed my studies where I learnt many things including C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, ASP.net, Game Development as well as MVC. My goal at the end of my time at younglings is to be a fully equiped Fullstack Developer by knowing the MEAN and MERN stacks.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies and interests would be to play games, like i said above I really enjoy playing games, not only on PC but on my phone as well and thats what actually made me choose a career path in software. I also enjoy cooking, from watching things on the web and then recreating them yourself is just something else. I recently started gymimg as well, I find that sitting behind a screen all day can be very unhealthy so gyming is where I would keep active and get my mind of things almost like a chance to take a break from the real world.</p>
            <p>Drawing is something that I really did not know I was really able to do until grade 11 in high school where I had a choice to draw whatever my heart desired in art class and thats where I saw that I have this talentto draw, I have uploaded some of my drawings inside my gallery page as well as some images that I have either taken myself or just found nice. My favourite interest I have is my car, it is a 1300 Tazz that i received as a gift from my grandparents, it is my little silver spaceship, not a fast spaceship but a more low and slow kind of spaceship.</p>
